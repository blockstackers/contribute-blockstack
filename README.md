# About /contribute-blockstack
This repo is the go-to resource for all Blockstack community projects. Use it to learn about all the work that community members are doing and discover ways to get involved yourself. 

**Background:** The Blockstack community is working to build a truly user-owned internet. As stakeholders in Blockstack, community members are involved at every level of the ecosystem, from developing the technology that enables Blockstack, to educating and onboarding newcomers in the crypto space. As a community member, there are many ways in which you can contribute to the growth of the Blockstack ecosystem. Some of the major ways in which you can get involved are outlined below:

## Engineering
Blockstack's engineering work is wide-ranging and well-documented. 

### Resources
- **Contribute Code:** Check out the [Blockstack GitHub](https://github.com/blockstack), especially the pinned repositories.
- **Learn How Blockstack Works:** Read the latest [Technical Whitepaper](https://blockstack.org/whitepaper.pdf).
- **Scan the Documentation:** Take a deeper dive into [specific technical topics in the docs](https://docs.blockstack.org/).

### Get Involved

Community developers and the Blockstack Engineering team meet (virtually) at least once a month to share technical updates and engineering knowledge. 
- Look out for the next meeting on the [community calendar](https://community.blockstack.org/events#tags=229080&start_date=2020-02-24&view=stream&range=events&events=20&end_date=2020-12-19).
- Check out [summaries of upcoming meetings](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/community/Engineering-Meetings).
- Review [notes from previous meetings](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/community/Dev-Calls).
- Talk to other community developers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SHAzPgM) in the meantime.

## Working Groups
Blockstack working groups are specialized community collectives focused on solving some of the greatest challenges within the Blockstack ecosystem. These groups meet regularly to discuss and work through the latest developments in Blockstack, including, but not limited to: the application of the Proof of Transfer consensus mechanism to the Stacks 2.0 blockchain, the formation of a governance system for Blockstack, and the adoption of new business models for apps built on Stacks 2.0.

> ### Proof of Transfer (PoX) Working Group
The PoX group is working through developments in Blockstack's breakthrough, proposed consensus mechanism, Proof of Transfer, ahead of the launch of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. Previously, this group contributed to the FAQ about PoX by examining the *Proof of Transfer Mining with Bitcoin* whitepaper and raising questions about it during a recent town hall meeting with over 100 community members in attendance. Currently, group members are researching ways for community members to combine Stacks (STX) holdings in order to earn Bitcoin through the Stacking consensus algorithm. This group is led by Production Partner at Blockstack PBC, Xan Ditkoff.

**Resources**
- **Learn about Proof of Transfer:** Read the [*Proof of Transfer Mining with Bitcoin*](https://blockstack.org/pox.pdf) whitepaper.
- **Understand Potential Applications of PoX:** Check out the Stacks Improvement Proposal [(SIP) 007](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/blob/develop/sip/sip-007-stacking-consensus.md).
- **Follow the Discussion:** Go through the Blockstack [Forum post](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/stacking-a-new-consensus-algorithm-for-blockchains/10162).

**Get Involved**

The PoX of transfer group generally meets every Thursday to discuss the latest news on this breakthrough consensus mechanism.

> ### Governance Working Group
The Governance group is working to develop a suitable governance model for the Blockstack ecosystem ahead of the formation of the Stacks Foundation, an independent entity supporting both governance and decentralization. This group is researching, exploring, and learning from successful and unsuccessful models of crypto governance in order to generate an official governance proposal. Should the proposal be accepted, it would be enforced by the Stacks Foundation. This group is led by independent researcher and consultant, Lane Rettig, and Head of Investor Relations at Blockstack PBC, Brittany Laughlin.

**Resources**
- **Background on Governance:** Go through the independent [resources repo](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources).

**Week 1:** Foundation announcement & working group (Feb 7) 

**Week 2:** Governance community call & onboard researcher (Feb 13)

> ### Business Model Working Group
The Business Model group is working to create an economy in the Blockstack ecosystem. This group is especially focused on developing around the utility of STX tokens; they are exploring innovative use cases for Clarity smart contracts, applications for app tokens, and building app chains. The Business Model group is particularly collaborative, experimental, and generally set up to operate like a "lab". Most meetings will be workshop or hackathon-style and many will feature external speakers. This group is led by Head of Growth at Blockstack PBC, Patrick Stanley.
